1- Type of website:

The website is a news website, or rather a recreation of a news site (the washington post)

2- Purpose of the website

The purpose is simply to apply the CSS knowledge we've learned to recreate the styling of a
major website, using our own methods and creativity.

3- The objective of the site

To create a 6 page website that focuses entirely on the individual page's styles.

4- What do you want the Web site to accomplish? What results do you want to see? 

We want the website to recreate the appearance of a multi million dollar website, at least in terms of styling,
using what we learned in our 2 or 3 weeks of CSS courses. 

5- What information do we need?

Since we are focusing mainly on the styling, we simply need to see a few different pages the original site uses.
The text and media content is sourced from the original site. 

6- What opportunity, problem, or issue is your site addressing

simply an opportunity to apply what we've learned in this past course.

7- Who is the intended audience? Will the audience consist of potential customers, current customers, or employees of a particular company or industry?

If we are legally allowed to use the site as a portfolio project, the potential audience could be future employers or customers.
