Overall Goal – What is the primary message of this Web page? What is this organization trying to communicate? 

The goal of the site is to advertise a renovation company and showcase it's work, and offer
a way for future customers to reach it

-------------------------------------------------------
What is the purpose of the site? Why do you think this organization wants to share this information? 
What do they have to gain?

Same as above, the point is to advertise and create new business opportunities

------------------------------------------------------- 
Who is the intended audience? Will the audience consist of potential customers, current customers, 
or employees of a particular company or industry?  Whom do you think this organization's message 
is directed to? Who would want to know this information? Do any of the following factors relate 
to your audience: age groups, social-economics, geography, gender, education, culture, etc.?

The audience would be potential customers, maybe business competition keeping track of what
their competition is up to, or just people looking for inspiration.
Since the website is directed towards customers mainly, and since renovation is quite expensive,
the audience would likely be in the age group of over 25-30 years of age, relatively well-off
(usually home-owners with funds to spare on renovating), living in the area, and statistically speaking
people in this demographic have a fair chance of being properly educated.

------------------------------------------------------- 
What are the objectives of the site? To advertise a company or organization, provide 
information to customers; provide a service, or process orders?

All the above except process orders, that would be replaced by booking consultations

------------------------------------------------------- 
What do you want the web site to accomplish? What results do you want to see? 

To create a template that can easily be modified to be a legitimate website for a company

------------------------------------------------------- 
What information do you need?  

For the template only basic information is required, such as which services can be offered
In order to have it be legitimate I would need actual content, such as pictures, testimonials, 
certifications, which I do not currently possess.

------------------------------------------------------- 
What opportunity, problem, or issue is your site addressing?

The opportunity is the use of the internet to promote a business
